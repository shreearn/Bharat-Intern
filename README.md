#1. Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM
This code uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict stock prices. LSTM networks are particularly useful for time series prediction due to their ability to maintain long-term dependencies.


Dataset: The dataset used in this project is NSE-TATAGLOBAL stock dataset, which contains historical stock prices of Tata Global Beverages from the National Stock Exchange of India.

Model Architecture

The LSTM model consists of three LSTM layers with 50 units each, followed by a dense layer with 1 unit. It is trained using the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss function.
